# Multi-Tenant SaaS Backend System

A scalable and secure backend system designed to support multi-tenant architecture with isolated user data and role-based access control (RBAC). The system is built with a modular architecture, focusing on flexibility, security, and maintainability‚Äîideal for SaaS platforms.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- Built using **Node.js (Express.js)** with a **MySQL (Sequelize ORM)** database.
- Supports **multi-tenant architecture** with tenant-aware user authentication and authorization.
- Implements **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage fine-grained access across roles like admin, manager, and user.
- JWT-based authentication for stateless session management.
- Modular Express.js structure with controllers, middleware, and routing for clean code separation.
- Working on integrating **subscription billing** using **Stripe/Razorpay**, with support for webhooks and invoice generation.
- Planning to implement **event-driven architecture** using **RabbitMQ/Kafka** and **Redis** for performance optimization.
- Deployment is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated using **Kubernetes**, with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring via **GitHub Actions**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana**.
